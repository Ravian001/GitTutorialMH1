            Collaborating on projects has always been a topic of discussion. 
            Today, collaboration has a huge effect on the flow of project. 
            Multiple people working on a project need to manage bulk of files.
            Obviously everyone knows that this can cause synchronization issues 
            let along other issues such as version management etc. For this purpose,
            the concept of VCS was introduced which makes collaboration on projects trivial.
            VCS stands for Version Control System. As evident from the name, this system
            is used for managing different versions of a project, hence tackling the problem
            of synchronization. On this webpage, you will find a brief tutorial to get you 
            started with git and a few commands followed with a case study, that will get
            you on track to collaborating your next project perfectly.  </p>

              <p class="card-body">After creating an account on github, you can create a new repository by
                going to your profile -> repositories -> new. After clicking on new, you will have to enter
                name that you want to display on your repository, repository's visibility (private/public),
                and add an optional description.

                <h3 class="card-header">Initializing a local repository</h3>
                <p class="card-body">After creating a new repository, you can initialize a local repository 
                  by the following command:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git init </strong>
                  <br><br>
                  Add the remote repository as it's origin so that your changes are backed up as your make 
                  progress. The newly created repository can be pointed to a local repository, 
                  using the following command:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git remote add origin [url]</strong>
                  <br><br>
                  An initialized local repository will have a .git hidden folder in it, as shown in the screenshot.
                  The url can be copied from the remote repository, but as a shortcut, the url is always
                  in the following format:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>https://github.com/[username]/[repository_name].git</strong>

                <h3 class="card-header">Add some files</h3>
                <p class="card-body">After setting up your first repository, remotely and locally, you can start
                  working on your project. You can start by creating a file, doing some work in it, and then adding
                  it to the stage. You can use the following command to view the status of stage:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git status</strong> get stage status
                  <br><br>
                  You can use the following command to add files to stage:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git add [file specifier]</strong> to add files

                <p class="card-body">After you have added your files, and staged them, you can save your work by
                   committing it. The following command is used to commit your unsaved changes.     
    
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git commit -m "[message]"</strong> to commit a change

                <p class="card-body">Deleted some files accidentally? Made some changes that caused a bug? Instead
                  of asking your team member for his copy or calling that bug a feature like a clown , you can use git's rollback
                  feature to rollback to a previous commit. First, check the hash of last working project commit you made,
                  in this case, "Done Important Work", by the following command:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git log</strong>
                  <br><br>

                  <br><br>
                  and then after noting down the first 7 digits of the corresponding commit hash, use following command
                  to rollback:
                  <strong>git reset --hard [commit_hash]</strong> to add files
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src= "gitpic8rollback.png">

                <h3 class="card-header">Create Branches</h3>
                <p class="card-body">When you start collaborating with other people, you can work simultaneously,
                  without the need of creating v1.zip, v2.01.zip, v3.01123.zip, or FINAL_LATEST_VERSION.zip by creating
                  branches. Git provides the feature of branching your project. You can create branches of your repository
                  and have some people work on a specific feature on one branch, and a group of other people on a second
                  feature on another branch. You can use the following commands to create a branch and to switch to another branch.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git branch [branch_name]</strong> to create a new branch with branch_name as branch name
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git branch</strong> to view all the branches in a repo

                  <strong>git push origin main [branch_name]</strong> to to push changes to branch_name branch

                  <br><br>
                  <strong>git fetch origin [branch_name]</strong> to fetch changes from a branch
